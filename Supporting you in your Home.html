Interchange can support you with your Daily Living Skills, Personal Care and Developing Capacity & Learning.

                <h2>Personal Care</h2>
                <p>Our friendly and experienced team at Interchange will take the time to understand your personal requirements and tailor personal care services specifically to you.
                    No matter if your needs are simple or complex, our trained Support Workers offer discreet and professional personal care in the way thatâ€™s most comfortable to you.
                    From supporting you a couple of hours a day to 24/7 Support â€“ We provide you with the support you want and need to feel comfortable and secure living in your home.</p>
                <h2>Daily Living Skills </h2>
                    <p>Daily Living Skills are all the things you like to do or need to do to live a happy and fulfilled life in your home. Interchange can help you with: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Your Home</b></li>
                <p>Do you have some chores at home? Letâ€™s get them done together! Cleaning and maintaining your home can be hard work but our Support Workers are there to give you a hand. Washing, ironing, cleaning or gardening are some of the life skills we can help you to build. We can also provide support to run your home by making sure bills are paid on time and helping you with home maintenance.</p>
                <li><b>Your Money and Budgeting</b></li>
                <p>Learning how to manage your own money is very important for your financial independence. We can support you with setting up and navigating your bank account and services. We can also assist you with effective budgeting and money planning to enhance your financial security. </p>
                <li><b>Your Nutrition</b></li>

Your Support Worker can work with you to plan your shopping lists and budgets, accompany you to the shops and help you get the things you need for your day-to-day life. </p> 
                <li><b>Your Hobbies</b></li>
                <p>Hobbies are a huge part of a fulfilled lifestyle and something you might want to take up. Maybe you love fishing, playing board games, painting or enjoy spending time at the beach.

Capacity Building Supports are an addition to Core Supports via the NDIS.

                <li>Taking care of yourself. </li>
