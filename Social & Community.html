            <p>As an active and engaged member of your local community you can develop valuable relationships, skills and a sense of belonging. Your Interchange Support Team will follow your lead, interests and goals to help you to connect with your community.</p>
            <p>We know that people with disability often feel alone and isolated,
                find it difficult to meet new friends or join activities they are interested in. One of Interchangeâ€™s core values is Belonging!
                As humans, we feel the need to belong. To one another, to our friends and families, to our community, culture and country. Without a strong sense of belonging, we can feel anxious, isolated and unsupported. Belonging is fundamental to your sense of happiness and well-being. We want to give you the support you need to feel like you belong and live a good life.</p>

That and many other activities are considered when supporting people with disability to participate in their local communities.

            <p><i>Gail (left) and Frances (right) having a game of chess at the local library.</i></p>
            <p>Meet Frances â€“ The 66-year-old, from our Myaree Neighbourhood, told us she has been struggling with Schizophrenia since the age of 12 and never expected anything to change. Distressing thoughts, erratic behaviour and several suicide attempts lead Fran down a very dark path.</p>            
            <p>After years of isolation Fran joined Interchange 18 months ago with two major goals â€“ living a happier and healthier life and to become part of her local community.
               The road to belonging was rocky for Fran.
               Her Support Worker Gail however isnâ€™t one to give up easily and over time the pair have built a relationship of trust and understanding.
               Fran has always wanted to learn to cook and Gail, a passionate cook herself, was keen to teach her.
               Fran has gone from being too scared to use an oven to having a huge list of recipes in her repertoire.
               The hobby chef now enjoys cooking for her friends and family, who love Franâ€™s newfound confidence as well as her yummy treats.</p>
            <p>Fran is now comfortably leaving the safety of her home and actively seeks fun things to do out in the community.
               One thing she always wanted to learn in life was chess and Gail now accompanies her to a local chess club every week.
               Her opponent Albert is quite the expert and even though Fran calls the rook a castle she feels like she finally belongs,
               is accepted for who she is, made new friends with similar interests and truly enjoys her life to the fullest.</p>
