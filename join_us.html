        <h2>Host Arrangements</h2>
        <h3>Share your life – Become a Host</h3>
        <p>
          A <a href="#">Host Arrangement</a> is a living arrangement where a
          host welcomes a person with disability to live in their home and be
          part of their lives. Through living in a natural environment and
          sharing their lives with the host, people with disability experience
          an enhanced sense of connection and belonging in their community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Becoming a Host can be suitable for you if you are single, a couple,
          or a family. You may offer your home for occasional stays or as a
          full-time residence. Each Host Arrangement is unique according to the
          person’s and host's circumstances.
        </p>

        <h3>The Values of Interchange</h3>
        <p>
          <q
            >When you are led by values, it doesn’t cost your business, it makes
            your business.”</q
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Every individual and every organisation is involved in making hundreds
          of decisions every day. The decisions we make reflect our values and
          beliefs. Our values inform our thoughts, words and actions, determine
          priorities and help us to grow and develop. Through values we are
          creating the future we want to experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Individuality, Respect, Empowerment and Belonging</strong>
          – these are the values Interchange as an organisation stands for. Our
          values are directed towards a specific purpose. Interchange’s purpose
          is to support people with disability to live a good life, foster
          welcoming communities that value, respect and empower people with

          Our Interchangers go above and beyond to provide quality services. So
          much passion and determination deserve recognition – That’s why we

        <p>
          With support teams from Two Rocks to Pinjarra you can join an
          Interchange Neighbourhood close to your home and support people within
          your local community. We work with state of the art IT Systems which
          manage your rostering, details of the person you support and other
          important information. This empowers you to self-organise, be flexible
          and manage other work and life commitments.
        </p>

        <h3>Engagement Opportunities</h3>
        <p>
          Have your say and shape our organisation. Become part of our
          Interchange iThinker Groups and share your experiences, ideas and
          hacks with other team members.

        <p>
          Remember the saying work hard, play hard? Well, our Interchangers
          always go the extra mile to support people with disability to live a
          good life – sometimes they just need to let loose. We encourage and
          create opportunities for Interchangers to come together, connect and
          enjoy yourselves. No work talk allowed 😊.

        <h3>Salary Packaging</h3>
        <p>

          competitive remuneration and 11% Superannuation, Interchange also
          offers Salary Packaging. Spend part of your pay before tax is

        <h3>Employee Assistance Program</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>It’s ok to not be ok!</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Supporting others is rewarding but there might be situations where you
          need support too. To help you when times are tough we have an
          <a href="#">Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</a>. You and your family
          can confidentially discuss problems and challenges in your life, at no
          cost to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          EAP is fully subsidised by Interchange and can help you and your
          immediate family members solve a wide range of problems with family,
          health, money, work and life. Find out more about our Employee
          Assistance Program <a href="#">HERE</a>.
